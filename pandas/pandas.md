# Pandas

## Features
* Data structures with labeled axes supporting automatic or explicit data alignment. This prevents common errors resulting from misaligned data and working with differently-indexed data coming from different sources.
* Integrated time series functionality.
* The same data structures handle both time series data and non-time series data.
* Arithmetic operations and reductions (like summing across an axis) would pass on the metadata (axis labels).
* Flexible handling of missing data.
* Merge and other relational operations found in popular database databases (SQL-based, for example)

## Data Structures
* from pandas import Series, DataFrame
